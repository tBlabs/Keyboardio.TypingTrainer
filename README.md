# Keyboardio.TypingTrainer

Simple typing trainer for any kind of keyboard. I wrote it for myself to practice fast typing on a Keybaordio keyboard.  
Existing apps are not good enough for my needs, because:
- they rarely use real words, I don't like random ones  
- they disallow you to define charset  
- they force you to use backspace  
- they are not suitable for programmers (no code-like expressions)  
- whatsmore I don't need all that typing statistics, they are useless and distracting  

# Code quality

Is terrible. Please do not look inside sources. App core has been dirty coded in two hours. It can not be good.
